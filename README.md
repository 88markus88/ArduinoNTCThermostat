# ArduinoNTCThermostat
This project is an Arduino based Thermostat for universal use. It contains the Arduino code and the KiCad files for the board.

## Features:
- Set for heating or cooling operation with a bridge
- Set target temperature in 2Â°C steps via DIP switches
- Set hysteresis via DIP switches
- 250V 10A relay
- 2 LEDs: power indicator and switch indicator
- Optional OLED display via I2C

## PCB
The PCB has been designed in Kicad. Kicad files are included in this repository, also the Gerber files that can directly be used to order the PCBs
